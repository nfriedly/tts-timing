From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Watson is a question answering computer system capable of answering questions posed in natural language, developed in IBM's DeepQA project by a research team led by principal investigator David Ferrucci.
Watson was named after IBM's first CEO and industrialist Thomas J. Watson.
The computer system was specifically developed to answer questions on the quiz show Jeopardy!.
In 2011, Watson competed on Jeopardy! against former winners Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings.
Watson received the first place prize of $1 million.

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Word Timings provided by the Watson Speech to Text service, essentially playing an automated game of telephone with the Text to Speech service.
    It's admittedly a bit crazy, but it does work.</p>

<p>Both options will play the audio and then log word timings to the console.</p>

<h3>Server-side processing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Uses less client bandwidth, but uses significantly more server-side bandwidth</li>
    <li>Allows for the audio to be captured and saved</li>
    <li>Can provide faster-than-realtime results</li>
    <li>Does not expose auth tokens (more secure)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Client-side processing</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Offers easy, built-in html output</li>
    <li>Uses more client bandwidth (to upload audio), but uses almost no server resources</li>
    <li>May provide slightly degraded results due to additional lossy audio conversions on the client side</li>
    <li>More limited browser support</li>
</ul>
